# Bookfinder
This bookfinder is my first Angular project. It uses google's book API to find the user more books written by an author that they like.
Using TypeScript and Angular was certainly a vast change from Vanilla JavaScript or React due to TypeScript being Strongly-typed, however I can understand how this may be an advantage in a team-based developing environment.

### Tech

This site uses the following languages & principles:

  - Angular
  - TypeScript
  - HTML
  - SCSS / CSS

And of course my bookfinder itself is open source, so feel free to pick and choose bits you like to host on your own GitHub!

### Todos

 - Make the displayed results look better on small screens (iPhone 6 size)
 - Add Light Mode
